## Getting Started

Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/TopBloc/code-challenge.git`

Run the frontend code within the `/client` folder:

cd client
npm install
npm run start

After running previous commands, you should see a website with instructions at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open the `/server` folder as a Maven project within a Java IDE and run the project. We suggest using IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Set the remote origin of this cloned project to your newly created GitHub repository:
```
git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/<github_username>/<favorite_animal>
```
3. Push your completed code challenge
